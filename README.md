## Description

This project is build using architecture `MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)`. It includes 2 screens, first screen is Listing Page and second is Detail Page. For Network requests, I have used Endpoints concept. I kept all my business logic in ViewModels keeping the Views dump. I have used cocoapods as dependency manager for this project. I have created my own custom framework for image Caching named as `ImageCache.framework`. I have used one third party library `MBProgressHUD`. Unit Tests are also included in this project making it fully testable.  

### Key Points
